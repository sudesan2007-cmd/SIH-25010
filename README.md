## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
**Detailed explanation of the proposed solution:**  
  A multilingual mobile and web application that offers personalized crop advisory by integrating soil data, weather forecasts, and AI-based pest detection. Farmers can upload images of affected crops for instant pest/disease identification and receive tailored recommendations on fertilizer use and irrigation scheduling.

- **How it addresses the problem:**  
  It replaces guesswork with real-time, data-driven advice. By combining AI image analysis, weather APIs, and soil health information, the system provides actionable insights in regional languages and voice format, making it accessible even to farmers with low literacy.

- **Innovation and uniqueness of the solution:**  
  - AI-powered pest detection via image uploads.  
  - Voice-enabled chatbot in multiple Indian languages.  
  - Integration of real-time market price data and predictive weather analytics.  
  - Personalized recommendations based on crop history and soil conditions.

## Technical Approach
**Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware):**  
  - Frontend: React Native (cross-platform mobile app)  
  - Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)  
  - Database: PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial data  
  - AI/ML: TensorFlow or PyTorch for pest detection, scikit-learn for yield prediction  
  - APIs: OpenWeatherMap API, Government Soil Health API  
  - Cloud: AWS or Azure for scalable deployment

- **Methodology and process for implementation (Flow Charts/Images/working prototype):**  
  1. Collect and preprocess soil, weather, and crop data.  
  2. Train machine learning models for pest/disease detection and predictive analytics.  

## Feasibility and Viability
**Analysis of the feasibility of the idea:**  
  The solution uses widely available APIs and mature AI/ML frameworks, making it technically achievable and cost-effective. Cloud-based infrastructure ensures scalability.

- **Potential challenges and risks:**  
  - Limited internet connectivity in rural regions.  
  - Variability and quality issues in soil and pest data.  
  - Training farmers to adopt and consistently use the app.

- **Strategies for overcoming these challenges:**  
  - Include an offline advisory mode with data syncing when connectivity is available.  
  - Collaborate with agricultural departments and NGOs for accurate data and outreach.  
  - Provide in-app tutorials, voice support, and local-language onboarding sessions.

## Impact and Benefits
**Potential impact on the target audience:**  
  Farmers gain reliable, scientific guidance that leads to better decision-making, higher crop yields, and improved income stability.

- **Benefits of the solution (social, economic, environmental, etc.):**  
  - **Social:** Empowers small and marginal farmers, reducing dependence on middlemen.
